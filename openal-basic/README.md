# OpenAL Basic Example

The most basic HashLink + OpenAL example. 

- Devices enumeration
- Context, source and buffer creation
- Loading a WAV file (using [`format`](https://lib.haxe.org/p/format/) library) and uploading the data to a newly created Buffer.
- Playing a source and querying playback position

**Compile:**

```bash
$ haxe hl.hxml
```
